// Hierarchical TanStack Query keys for the 1.6 data layer. Two families live under
// the `'transactions'` root and are disambiguated by key[1]:
//   - list:    ['transactions', filters]           (filters is the STABLE slice)
//   - summary: ['transactions', 'summary', month]
// so the list-only invalidation predicate `key[1] !== 'summary'` (see
// data/transactions.ts) never blanket-refetches every cached month's summary.
//
// AM-1.6-a: `offset` is the useInfiniteQuery page cursor (pageParam), NOT a key
// member — pages accumulate under one entry and invalidation refetches all loaded
// pages. `TxListFilters` is exactly the stable filter slice.
